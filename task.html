<h1>Origami</h1>>
<h2>What is Origami</h2>
<p>Origami (折り紙, Japanese pronunciation: [oɾiɡami] or [oɾiꜜɡami], from ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper" \
(kami changes to gami due to rendaku)) is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture.
In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. 
The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. 
Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. 
Origami folders often use the Japanese word kirigami to refer to designs which use cuts.</p>
<h2>What is the history of origami</h2>
Distinct paperfolding traditions arose in Europe, China, and Japan which have been well-documented by historians. 
These seem to have been mostly separate traditions, until the 20th century.
In China, traditional funerals often include the burning of folded paper, most often representations of gold nuggets (yuanbao). 
The practice of burning paper representations instead of full-scale wood or clay replicas dates from the Song Dynasty (905–1125 CE), 
though it is not clear how much folding was involved. In Japan, the earliest unambiguous reference to a paper model is in a short poem
by Ihara Saikaku in 1680 which mentions a traditionalbutterfly design used during Shinto weddings. Folding filled some ceremonial functions in Edo period Japanese culture; noshi were attached
to gifts, much like greeting cards are used today. This developed into a form of entertainment; the first two instructional books published
in Japan are clearly recreational. In Europe, there was a well-developed genre of napkin folding, which flourished during the 17th and 18th
centuries. After this period, this genre declined and was mostly forgotten; historian Joan Sallas attributes this to the introduction of 
porcelain, which replaced complex napkin folds as a dinner-table status symbol among nobility. However, some of the techniques and bases
associated with this tradition continued to be a part of European culture; folding was a significant part of Friedrich Froebel's "Kindergarten"
method, and the designs published in connection with his curriculum are stylistically similar to the napkin fold repertoire. Another example 
of early origami in Europe is the "parajita," a stylized bird whose origins date from at least the nineteenth century.
When Japan opened its borders in the 1860s, as part of a modernization strategy, they imported Froebel's Kindergarten system—and with it, 
German ideas about paperfolding. This included the ban on cuts, and the starting shape of a bicolored square. These ideas, and some of the
 European folding repertoire, were integrated into the Japanese tradition. Before this, traditional Japanese sources use a variety of
  starting shapes, often had cuts; and if they had color or markings, these were added after the model was folded.
<h2>What is the importance of origami</h2>
<p> <h3>Geometry</h3>
    According to the National Center for Education Statistics in 2003, geometry was one area of weakness among American students. Origami has been found to strengthen an understanding of geometric concepts, formulas, and labels, making them come alive. Here’s how to use it in your class (PDF). By labeling an origami structure with length, width, and height, students will learn key terms and ways to describe a shape. You can use origami to determine the area by applying a formula to a real-world structure.
    
    <h3>Thinking Skills</h3>
    Origami excites other modalities of learning. It has been shown to improve spatial visualization skills using hands-on learning. Such skills allow children to comprehend, characterize, and construct their own vernacular for the world around them. In your class, find origami or geometric shapes in nature and then describe them with geometric terms.
    
    <h3>Fractions</h3>
    The concept of fractions is scary to lots of students. Folding paper can demonstrate the fractions in a tactile way. In your class, you can use origami to illustrate the concepts of one-half, one-third, or one-fourth by folding paper and asking how many folds students would need to make a certain shape. The act of folding the paper in half and in half again and so on can also be used to demonstrate the concept of infinity.
    
   <h3> Problem Solving</h3>
    Often in assignments, there is one set answer and one way to get there. Origami provides children an opportunity to solve something that isn't prescribed and gives them a chance to make friends with failure (i.e. trial and error). In your class, show a shape and ask students to come up with a way to make it. They may get the solution from various approaches. Remember, there is no wrong answer.
    
    <h3>Fun Science</h3>
    Origami is a fun way to explain physics concepts. A thin piece of paper is not very strong, but if you fold it like an accordion it will be. (Look at the side of a cardboard box for proof.) Bridges are based on this concept. Also, origami is a fun way to explain molecules. Many molecules have the shape of tetrahedrons and other polyhedra.
